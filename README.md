## Project Name

World's GDP from 1960 to 2013

### Data set

World Bank data

### Description

It is an interactive data visualization that shows the world's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) from 1960 to 2013 on a world map. It is developed for showing and learning world's economy development in the recent half century. It shows each year's world GDP map by sliding the slider or using auto play. Hovering over a country on the map shows that country's GDP detail.

Domain and techniques

features

Effectness 

Think about why the domain and the techniques are a good match for one another. Be sure to explain the features of your application. Most importantly you should explain why the interaction techniques you will implement will be effective in the context of your data domain.

## Running Instructions

Access our visualization at http://xiaoyizhang.me/512/test.html

OR

Clone the repo, run "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080" in the terminal under the repo directory.

Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080

## Story Board



### Changes between Storyboard and the Final Implementation


## Development Process
Firstly, we browserd the available data sets and searched for interesting ones. For our interested data sets we try to come up a design with it and see if it works well. We select World Bank data sets, since we all interested in knowing about how the world's economy developed among the countries. Xin processed the data to our deired data format. Based on the data selected, we design an interactive data visualization story board. Basically, it is an interactable world map showing world's GDP. Xiaoyi implement the map interaction function. After we got the interactive map works, Yanling changed the webpage and detail design, and write the writup. 

Yanling He: Design the page layout, draw story board and writeup
Xiaoyi Zhang: Inplement interavtive map with sliding and hovering functions
Xin Yang: Found data set and procesing data

We discussed about data set selection and data visualization design for couple days, each day about 30 min discussion. Then for the full implementation we used about 2 days. Selecting data and thinking about the design cost some time, also searching the desired tools and looking the documentation costs most time.
